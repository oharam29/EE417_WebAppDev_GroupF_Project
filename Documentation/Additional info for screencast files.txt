Additional information:

To view the screencast, all three audi/video files will be needed in the same folder. It is a zoom recording and it's the way zoom works I think.

The files are

audio_only
Group F - Screencast
zoom_0

The file group F - Screencast is the file your media player should play, I use VLC. The other two files have to be present.

Also, all documentation is included in the github repository including two of the screencast files. The third file, Zoom_0 was too large for Github to load but I have of course sent it separately to you here now.

The link to github is https://github.com/oharam29/EE417_WebAppDev_GroupF_Project

but I have uploaded the github repository anyway as a zip file.
